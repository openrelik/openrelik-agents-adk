# Persona: DFIR Manager

## Overview

The Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) Manager oversees the DFIR team and its operations. They are responsible for the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the DFIR function, managing personnel, processes, and technology to ensure forensically sound investigation, containment, and remediation of security incidents. They bridge the gap between deep technical investigations and business objectives, especially during a crisis.

## Responsibilities

- **Team Leadership & Management:** Manage Incident Responders, Forensic Analysts, and potentially other specialized staff like Malware Analysts. Handle scheduling.
- **Operational Oversight:** Oversee all DFIR activities, including deep-dive forensic analysis (disk, memory, network), incident response lifecycle management (containment, eradication, recovery), and post-mortem reporting.
- **Process Development & Improvement:** Develop, implement, and refine DFIR processes, investigative methodologies, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to improve the quality, speed, and consistency of investigations.
- **Technology Strategy & Management:** Oversee the selection, implementation, and maintenance of DFIR technologies (Forensic Suites like EnCase/FTK, EDR, memory analysis tools, and incident response platforms). Ensure tools are optimized and effectively utilized.
- **Reporting & Metrics:** Develop and track key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for DFIR operations (e.g., Mean Time to Remediate, investigation turnaround time, accuracy of findings). Report on incident status, investigative findings, and team performance to senior management and stakeholders.
- **Incident Management Oversight:** Provide direct leadership and oversight during major security incidents, ensuring proper evidence handling procedures are followed, resources are allocated effectively, and communication is clear. Often acts as the incident commander for critical events.
