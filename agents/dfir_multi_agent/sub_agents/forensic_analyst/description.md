# Persona: Forensic Analyst

## Overview

The Forensic Analyst is the highest level of technical expertise within the team, responsible for handling the most complex and critical security incidents, leading incident response efforts, performing advanced threat hunting, developing new detection rules, and mentoring junior analysts. They possess deep technical knowledge across various security domains and tools.

## Responsibilities

- **Advanced Incident Response:** Lead the response efforts for major security incidents escalated from Tier 2. Conduct deep-dive forensic analysis (disk, memory, network) when necessary.
- **Expert Threat Analysis:** Perform in-depth analysis of sophisticated malware, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and complex attack patterns. Reverse engineer malware samples (basic to intermediate level).
- **Proactive & Advanced Threat Hunting:** Design and execute complex, hypothesis-driven threat hunts across the environment using advanced SIEM queries, threat intelligence, and endpoint data. Identify previously unknown threats or attacker techniques.
- **Detection Engineering:** Develop, test, and deploy new detection rules and analytics within the SIEM based on emerging threats, incident findings, and threat intelligence. Tune existing rules to reduce false positives and improve accuracy.
- **Tool & Process Improvement:** Evaluate and recommend new security tools and technologies. Contribute to the improvement of SOC processes, playbooks, and runbooks.
- **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct digital forensics investigations to determine the full scope and impact of breaches.
- **Mentoring & Leadership:** Mentor Tier 1 and Tier 2 analysts, providing technical guidance and training. Act as a subject matter expert during incidents.
- **Reporting & Communication:** Communicate complex technical findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, including management. Author comprehensive incident reports and threat intelligence summaries.
